```

- `biom_2017.tsv` is a TSV file in [BIOM](https://biom-format.org/) format
produced from the reports contained in `reports_2017.tar.gz`.
- `amr_2017.tar.gz` contains [RGI](https://github.com/arpcard/rgi)'s TSV outputs
with information on the identified antimicrobial resistance markers at
[allele](https://github.com/arpcard/rgi#rgi-bwt-read-mapping-results-at-allele-level)
and [gene](https://github.com/arpcard/rgi#rgi-bwt-read-mapping-results-at-gene-level)
levels for every sample of 2017, using [CARD and WildCARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/)
